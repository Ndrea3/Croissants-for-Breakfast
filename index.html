      Baked goods are foods that are baked with grains and/or cereal products. A
      distinction is made between bread, small baked goods (e.g. rolls,
      pretzels), pastries (e.g. croissants, puff pastry), and dry baked goods
      (e.g. gingerbread).

      Pastry is characterized by its flaky and crumbly texture, and rich buttery
      flavor. Shelf life of filled pastry is dependent on free water
      availability and susceptibility to moisture migration. Typical pastry
      shelf life ranges from a couple of days for meat-containing pastries, to a
      few weeks for high sugar fillings.
